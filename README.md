# Customer Churn & Sales Analytics Project

## Project Highlights
- End-to-end data science workflow (EDA → ML → Insights)
- Business recommendations included
- Random Forest used for churn prediction

## Business Problem
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses as acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones.  
This project aims to analyze customer behavior, identify key churn drivers, and build a machine learning model to predict customers likely to churn.

## Dataset
Telco Customer Churn Dataset  
- Customer demographics  
- Services subscribed  
- Billing information  
- Churn status (Target variable)

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identify churn influencing factors
- Build and evaluate machine learning models
- Provide actionable business recommendations

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Approach
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Model building and evaluation
5. Business insights and recommendations

## Results
- Random Forest achieved the best performance with high recall
- Tenure, contract type, and monthly charges were key churn drivers

## Business Recommendations
- Improve onboarding for new customers
- Offer incentives for long-term contracts
- Target high-risk customers with retention campaigns
